		<h2>Before you head out!</h2>
		<p>There are some rules you have to follow before heading out into the Arizona desert with an offroad vehicle. I will cover the important ones here to keep you safe and out of trouble while having fun.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spark Arrestor</li>
			<p>In Arizona it is very important to have a spark arrestor in your exhaust. Due to dry conditions most of the year, you need to be sure no wild fires can be started.</p>
			<li>Noise Dissipative Device</li>
			<p>This is in regards to a muffler. Most dirt bikes will be in compliance with this rule but if you install any aftermarket parts, make sure to check it complies with the rules of where you will be riding at.</p>
			<li>Safety Flag</li>
			<p>This is required at almost every sand dune or single track location. This is to help anyone who may be coming over a hill or around a blind corner to be aware of someone who could be coming straight at them. In most cases you will not be able to just hear someone coming as there is a lot going on at most of these places, so it is good practice to use a safety flag just in case.</p>
			<li>Arizona OHV Decal</li>
			<p>This is the most important rule to follow. In order to ride on public or state trust lands, you are required by state law to have one of these. There are serious consequences to not getting one of these stickers.</p>
